**achille** wouldn't have come into existence if not for prior work
by many talented people. This page is here to give some pointers to the origin
of **achille** and references to look up.

### Hakyll

[Hakyll] is perhaps the biggest inspiration for **achille**. I'd like to express
my gratitude to Jasper and all the contributors. While I may have stated a bit
awkwardly before that **achille** was intended as a replacement for [Hakyll], I
don't actually think this is the case. I think they target very different
audiences, and in most regards [Hakyll] is what people should use. **achille**
is just my humble attempt at seeing how far we can push the concept.
