**achille** is an embedded Haskell DSL for building incremental static site generators.

It has a very simple abstraction for composable build rules, a straightforward
implementation and very few dependencies.

For more information on how **achille** works and how to use it, you can [read the
documentation](https://acatalepsie.fr/projects/achille/).
