## achille

**achille** is a tiny Haskell library for building static site generators.
It is in spirit a direct successor to [Hakyll].

[Hakyll]: https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/

It is self-contained, has few dependencies and a very simple abstraction for composing
build rules. It also offers fast fine-grained incremental builds.

For more information how **achille** works and how to use it, you can [read the
documentation](https://acatalepsie.fr/projects/achille/).
